# Sprint-01 Grading Rubric

## Grading Style

The first sprint report will be a cumulative grading effort, with each student contributing their part, which will form the whole grade.

## Points

The assignment will be 100 points cumulative.

- 20 points for the UI/UX portion
- 20 points for the Security Assumptions
- 20 points for IT and Infrastructure Report
- 20 points for Developer and Coding assumptions
- 10 points for the cumulative report and listing of goals for the next sprint
- 10 points for the Presentation style
  
  - The grading for the presentation will be a standard presentation
  - Was there a clear opening?
  - Was there a clear explanation of the entire report content (not read of the page)?
  - Was there a clear conclusion?

Each section will be graded on a Likert Scale:

- Meets expectations
- Somewhat meets expectations
- Somewhat meets expectations, with a few missing items
- Doesn't meet expectations
- Non-effort
- 20, 16, 15, 12, and 5 points respectively
- 10, 8, 7, 6, and 5 points respectively

## Content

The deliverable will be a single file named **sprint-01.md** located in a folder named **sprint-01** under the **reports** folder in your team GitHub repo.

Report will include the entire Application or user story delivered in screenshots or mock-ups.  There will be two to three stories:

- The User story
  - Show how a user will interact with and use your site
- The Admin Story
  - Show how an admin user will interact with and use your site
- If applicable, show how an unauthenticated user will interact with your site

These *screens* will be generated by you by a tool of choice, hand drawn on paper and scanned are not acceptable artifacts.

## Individual Deliverables

This story will weave together the contributions of each team member into a single narrative.

### UI/UX

Explain why the team chose the type of setup and UI/UX displayed,  Use references from previous classes or cite comparable existing websites.  Explain any features of the applications as well (mobile, assistive technology, etc, etc)

### Developer

Explain why the team chose the type of language framework they did.  Explain where this framework is used in existing commercial applications and any benefits of the language framework.

### Junior Developer and Security

Explain any security assumptions made about the application in regards to security, encryption, firewalls, authentication mechanisms, and any others items you see fit

### Operating Systems and IT Infrastructure

Explain the choice of operating systems and platforms.  Explain datastore choice as well as demonstrate the SQL schema for the database you will implement based on the UI/UX drawings

### Project Manager

Will gather the contributed portions into a single narrative (be careful just copying and pasting) -- see the template.md for a standard template.   They will give the presentation overall, as well as gather what the atomic goals for the next semester will be based on the input gathered in this first sprint.

## Deliverable

The Project Manager will submit the URL to the sprint-01.md on GitHub, it will be a group submission so only one is needed.  Don't forget!
