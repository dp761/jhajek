Two person team selects the book chapter they will present. You are to
read the chapter and create a PowerPoint Presentation covering the
content of the chapter(s). At the conclusion of the presentation you
need to include 3 review questions, at least 4 review questions if you
cover 2 chapters, and 6 review questions is you cover 3 chapters.

Time limit is 10 minutes exactly. Come ahead of time prepared for the
presentation to start right away. All team members need to talk during
the event.

From these questions I will draw the material for the Final Exam.
